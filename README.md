Dear Mr. MarinKovic,
From your Links I found several test. Both for frontend and backend. 

From there I found the following link is for frontend (for me)
https://github.com/WATTx/code-challenges/blob/master/frontend-engineer-challenge-top-coins.md

And about the api. you said this  (The app should fetch all the required data from the coinmarketcap.com /ticker API endpoint.)

From your above links I could several abut I guess the following api is for me. Am I right?
https://api.coinmarketcap.com/v2/ticker/


Could you please confirm me if anything misunderstanding ?


Best regards
